# Python_Election_Analysis

## Project Overview:

#### The Colorado Board of Elections has tasked us to do the following:

1. Determine the total number of votes cast
2. Create a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculate the total votes for each candidate
4. Calculate the % of votes receive
5. Provide each county and their total vote count
6. Determine what % of votes each county provided
7. Determine the county with the largest number of votes
8. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Election-Audit Python Code Summary:
    The python code provided was robust and can be used for any state wide election given the following:

    1. A seperate CSV file for each election was provides
    2. A seperate election analysis txt file
    3. This code (with some refactoring where neccessary)can be used for any state wide election
